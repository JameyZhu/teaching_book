## 7.2 motif analysis

HOMER contains a program called `findMotifsGenome.pl` that can find enriched motifs in ChIP-Seq peaks

```bash
findMotifsGenome.pl part.peak sacCer2 part.motif.output -len 8
```

### Important parameters

- `Region Size`
  \("-size &lt;\#&gt;", "**-size &lt;\#&gt;,&lt;\#&gt;**", "**-size given**", default: 200\)  
  The size of the region used for motif finding is important.  If analyzing ChIP-Seq peaks from a transcription factor, Chuck would recommend 50 bp for establishing the primary motif bound by a given transcription factor and 200 bp for finding both primary and "co-enriched" motifs for a transcription factor.  When looking at histone marked regions, 500-1000 bp is probably a good ideaã€‚

- `Motif length`
  \("-len &lt;\#&gt;" or "-len &lt;\#&gt;,&lt;\#&gt;,...", default 8,10,12\)In general, it's best to try out enrichment with shorter lengths \(i.e. less than 15\) before trying longer lengths.

- `Number of motifs to find`
  \("-S &lt;\#&gt;", default 25\)  
  Specifies the number of motifs of each length to find.  25 is already quite a bit.
